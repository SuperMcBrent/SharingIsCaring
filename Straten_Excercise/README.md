# Straten

Excercise 'Straten' received on 2020/02/21.

Solution is Object Oriented.

Code is quick&dirty and needs to be refactored.

Folderbuilder is still broken, "fr" folders are empty.

Need to decide whether i put both the fr and nl cities in both the fr and nl folders,
or do i sort them nl cities -> nl folders, fr cities -> fr folders?
